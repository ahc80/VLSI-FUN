Simulator for the Preprocessor

Simulate (input)

X = C AND A
Y = C' AND B

Z = X AND Y

Z = _______|¯|_______
or 
Z = ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|_|¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Basic Simulator

all input + x
simulate the ckt
n set 1 

L1:
while (obj is possible) {
    Primary Implicant <= trace fanin with x
    assign (PI <= value)
    simulatepush PI => Stack;
}

if (objective acieved) {
    print the Stack();
    pop all PI from the stack;
    set PI < X
    simulate
}
return

If it doesnt work something is not good

first decision:
if (decision is = 1) {
    reverse decision;
    simulate ()
    goto L1
}

L2
while (decision top = 2) {
    pop PI
    assign PI = X
    simulate
}

//Stakc is empty and no gate
//That line is redundant
if (stack empty){
    return obj is redundant
}
//else if it not empty go check something else
go to L2
