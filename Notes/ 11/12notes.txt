//This is the internal processing for the gate that saab showed in class.

Linked list of a linked list -> NO LINKED LIST
Only the gates get the number in integer
Array of tracker

Microcontroller becomes a simulator

In his example nameing the gate
-> Gate A and Gate B = 0
-> Buffer1 and Buffer2 = 1

# of Gates
Type level fanin fanout time.delay string
== Way to simulate the circuit

Build a Optimization using this.

//Saab's first attempt?

l = ckt;
for each gate g olo
fout (f = g.fout: f ; f = next fout){
    Buff if <- read gate (Ifount, f???) {
        Buff fan in = g;
        buff fan out = f;
        f - Buff;
    }
    Buff.enxt = tail;
    tail = Buff
}

//Optimization Version

temp = tail

for (L = ckt; l; l =l.net){
    for (f = l.fout; f; f = f.next){ //This is the Gate
        Buff = creategate(1fanin, 1fout)
        Buff.fanin = l;
        Buf.fanout = f
        Buff.next = tail //Thi sis the gates
        tail.next = Buffer 
    }
    if l = tail
        return
}

readck 
    -> fanin 
        -> processfanin 
            -> fanout 
                -> processfanout 
                    -> circuit with buffer 
                        -> order it with the gates that (maximum number on input +1)
                        -> naming convention?
                        -> use to track the order for the gates
                            -> 

How many gates
How many fanin and fanout

How many allocations needed
So you dont need to do anything anymore
